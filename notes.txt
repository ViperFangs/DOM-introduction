We can refer to other elements in DOM with their relationship (e.g. Parent relation, sibling relation)

element.querySelector(selector) returns a reference to the first match of selector
element.querySelectorAll(selectors) returns a “nodelist” containing references to all of the matches of the selectors

It’s important to note that when using querySelectorAll, the return value is not an array. It looks like an array, and it somewhat acts like an array, but it’s really a “nodelist”.
